## Student Management System
This project was the final assignment for the `IITS2001-3005 Java Server Programming` course at Vaasa University of Applied Sciences.

### Goals
A simple student management system needs to be created with the following requirements in mind:
- REST API for authentication, managing users and courses
- Authorization (only authorized users should be able to add user and course data)
- Everone should be able to list courses and users

### Bonus requirements:
- Make a decent looking UI for the project
- Implement an API endpoint to list users enrolled to a given course
- Implement an API endpoint to sign up users

#

### Notes
Certain things (let's face it - almost everything) could be implemented in a better way especially on the frontend, where there's significant code duplication. But what the hell...
